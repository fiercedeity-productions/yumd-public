# YuMD

YuMD is an extension of Markdown allowing for the typesetting of rich and complex notes, with first-class support for flashcard creation directly within your notes. YuMD lets you
1. create and sync flaschards between `.yumd` notes and Anki, avoiding the need to write out notes multiple times,
1. export notes into LaTeX to create well-typeset PDFs, and
1. (for advanced users) export notes into HTML files for further processing.

The documentation for YuMD is itself written in YuMD, and can be viewed [as a PDF](https://nbviewer.org/github/james-b-yu/yumd-public/blob/main/0.9.0/documentation/yumd-documentation.pdf), or [as YuMD source code](https://github.com/james-b-yu/yumd-public/blob/main/0.9.0/documentation/yumd-documentation.yumd).

# Installation
To install the VSCode extension, download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/james-b-yu/yumd-public/releases) of YuMD. **You only need `vscode-extension.zip` if you plan to use YuMD with VSCode.**

After unzipping, open VSCode, run the command (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Command+Shift+P`) `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`, and navigate to `yumd.vsix`.

Open a `.yumd` file and begin notetaking!

Please read through [the documentation](https://nbviewer.org/github/james-b-yu/yumd-public/blob/main/0.9.0/documentation/yumd-documentation.pdf) for a primer on how to use YuMD. Reading through the [`.yumd` source of the documentation](https://github.com/james-b-yu/yumd-public/blob/main/0.9.0/documentation/yumd-documentation.yumd) could be even more informative, by getting familiar with YuMD syntax as you read.
