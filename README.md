# YuMD

YuMD is an extension of Markdown allowing for the typesetting of rich and complex notes, with first-class support for flashcard creation from directly within your notes. YuMD lets you
1. create and directly sync flaschards between `.yumd` notes and Anki, avoiding the need to write out notes multiple times,
1. export notes into LaTeX to create well-typeset PDFs, and
1. (for advanced users) export notes into HTML files for further processing.

The documentation for YuMD is itself written in YuMD, and can be viewed [as a PDF](https://nbviewer.org/github/fiercedeity-productions/yumd-public/blob/main/0.9.0/documentation/yumd-documentation.pdf), or [as YuMD source code](https://github.com/fiercedeity-productions/yumd-public/blob/main/0.9.0/documentation/yumd-documentation.yumd).
